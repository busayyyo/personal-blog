Hi there, my name is Busayo and I'm a UX and usability engineer. I have a bachelors degree in psychology and a masters degree in psychology. I design experiences, services and products with a balance of business orientation and human centered design approach. I also write frontend code and I enjoy bringing interface design to life.

I enjoy writing - both words and code. In my free time, I serve as the managing editor at [millennial poets](https://medium.com/@millennialpoets).
