Hi there, my name is Busayo and I'm a writer and usability engineer. I have a bachelors degree in psychology and a masters degree in usability engineering. I'm interested in human centered design and innovation, literature , the psychology of choices and decisions, and the old age question of 'why the fuck are we here?'

In my blog, I will be exploring design, frontend development, psychology and books that I find compelling.
