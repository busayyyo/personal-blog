Hi there, my name is Busayo and I'm a UX and usability engineer at Siegwerk AG. I have a bachelors degree in psychology and I'm currently rounding up my masters in usability engineering. I design experiences, services and products and I do it from a human centered design approach. I also write frontend code and I enjoy bringing interface design to life.

I enjoy solving problems and writing - words and code. In my free time, I serve as the managing editor at [millennial poets](https://medium.com/@millennialpoets).
