Hi there, my name is Busayo and I'm on a pursuit of knowledge. I know some things in part, I know nothing in full, so I'm in a race to know as much as I can, knowing that I may never know enough, but trying anyways.

I have a Bsc in Psychology and Msc in Usability engineering. I work as a UX designer. 

Right now I'm fascinated about topics such as innovation in developing countries, existentialism and the psychology of fear.

I love a well written book and I could drown in poetry. I curate poetry from Millennials around the world at [MillennialPoets](https://medium.com/millennial-poets)

I write to know more, I write to act out, I write to understand me, and perhaps understand the world.
