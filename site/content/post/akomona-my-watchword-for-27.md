Akomona, also known as watchword, are affirmations that a lot of pentecostal Nigerian church goers are familiar with. I grew up as one of these pentecostals. 

On new year's eve we would go to church and pray to receive a new watchword for the new year. These watchwords, excerpts from bible passages, would be printed and pasted on our cars, entrances, books and about anything that had a surface. I always imagined that this dramatic pasting of these akomonas was not just so we could see it and be reminded of our affirmations of the year, we pasted them everywhere so everyone would know and be reminded of our identity and stance, and because we were Nigerians, to also ward off evil and anyone who might mean us harm. The watchword was more than a reminder, it was a psychological and spiritual tactic deployed to get us through the year in one piece, since we were smart enough to know that health insurance would simply not do.

Waking up a day into my 27th year, I couldn't stop thinking of my akomona. What is my watchword? What piece of writing could get me through this 27th year, so dangerously close to 30. What is a short sweet mantra I could have pasted on a wall and could recall for every disappointment that was bound to come my way in 27? What affirmations could hold firm a girl in her late 20's against the strong sway of societal expectations? Who would write me one? Cos lord knows, I need one.

27 feels different from all the previous ages combined. I could tell in the way my mother wished me happy birthday, asking what was next now, subtly and not so subtly hinting at the next logical choice for women in their late twenties - the bliss of marital life. I could tell by the simple arithmetic of 30 - 27; the result so less than, yet so dangerously weightier than 30 - 25. At 25, anything seemed possible; at 27, anything is possible _but_ within a time limit. Of course 27 is objectively young if the arithmetic is done with a different set of numbers, say, 85 - 27, assuming one would live a relatively long life barring illnesses and random accidents. 

However, this arithmetic objectivity does not really apply to women. Somehow, we've had it ingrained in us that the prime of our lives simply ended at 30. It's a collective psyche of burden, in which we only have 12 years of youthful freedom if we are lucky, and at 30 we must have incurred upon ourselves the responsibility of taking care of a husband and children. To not adhere to this script is to be a rebel. 

So at 27, one is looking down a barrel of a gun - _I_ am looking down the barrel of a gun about to watch my prime be blown to bits.

So what affirmations do you have for those of us who are about to die?

I couldn't think of anyone other than Audre Lorde to dispense with the last rites of my prime years. If there was anything Lorde was known for, it's being a rebel. A great poet, novelist, and activist for sure, but a rebel. Nothing is quite rebellious as being you, defying the scripts and the boxes society seeks to place you in. 

At a Malcom X (another rebel) weekend address at Harvard in 1982, Audre Lord described the issue of societal imposed identities and how they could be catastrophic if one does not define and affirm one's life: _As a Black lesbian mother in an interracial marriage, there was usually some part of me guaranteed to offend everybody's comfortable prejudices of who I should be. If I didn't define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people's fantasies for me and eaten alive_.

So here's my Audre Lorde inspired akomona for my 27th year:  **Fuck the scripts, fuck the damn scripts. I will write my own story.**
