David's a good guy. You would know that, because he tells you so.

He beats his chest and tells you he's a good guy. He's unlike Jackson, the arrogant ass. Unlike Tim, the pompous fool.

He reels you in with a smile on his face and so you believe him. But the air would still be dense with humidity when he'd throw you back in the water, a smirk on his face.

'I'm not trying to be an ass here, that was a slip,' he would say with a furrow in his brows, his left hand digging a pointed stick in your back, picking you up from the water he had thrown you.

Whatever damage he causes is on account of him 'just trying to live'. You are but the casualty of living - a guaranteed. Can you see now? It's not his fault.

When you confront him with the unintended consequences of his actions, he flares up like a caged tiger. You've rattled his bliss, you see? 

His goodness is his armour. He wears it well, convincingly so. 

He could never be like Jackson, nor Tim. He's not that interesting. He's too busy shielding his mediocrity with goodness.
