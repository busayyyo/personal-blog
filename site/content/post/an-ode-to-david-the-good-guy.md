David is a good guy. You would know this, because he tells you so.

He beats his chest and says he's unlike Jackson, the arrogant ass. Unlike Tim, the pompous fool.

He reels you in with a warm smile and throws you back in with a smirk on his face.

'I'm not trying to be an ass here, that was a slip,' he would say with a furrow in his brows, his left hand digging a pointed stick in your flesh to pick you back up - but not before he has demanded gratitude for his would-be benevolent act.

Whatever damage he causes is on account of him _just trying to live_. You are but the casualty of living. Can you see now? It's not his fault.

When you confront him with the unintended consequences of his actions, he flares up like a caged tiger. You've rattled his bliss, you see? 

His goodness is his armour, he wears it well. 

He could never be like Jackson, nor Tim. He's not that interesting. He's too busy shielding his mediocrity with goodness.
