Gifs (however you may pronounce it) are fun animated pictures or videos extracts. They can make your website come alive if used well and can be an alternative to writing CSS animations. And the best part of all, they are simple to use! All it takes is a few lines of code:

```
body {background-image: url(your gif url)}
```

You can go further to add other background properties such as background-repeat if you want the gif repeated across the screen. This would be useful when the size of the gif is small.

View a sample in the codepen below:

<iframe height="265" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="Gif as background image" src="https://codepen.io/Busayyyo/embed/jOOWzLy?height=265&theme-id=0&default-tab=html,result" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">
