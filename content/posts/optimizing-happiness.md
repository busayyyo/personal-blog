  guarantee. But while you wait for the sadness to pass, here's how you can
  optimise for happiness.

When you go through the lows, as we inevitably must go through, either by loss, the pain of rejection, things not going the way we imagined, or the doom of living made weightier by shitty weather; happiness slowly drips to a stop. Or it feels like that. It feels like the well of happiness is dry, and there would never be joy again. You could become skeptical, and think or perhaps realise that whatever happiness there is, is always short-lived - a pit stop between now and the next crisis.\

But I've been thinking lately that maybe happiness isn't drops of water in a dry well. Maybe happiness instead is the big blue sky that you sometimes can't see beneath the grey clouds. But it's right there. It has to be right there. 

So, I'm learning new tricks for the days when the clouds are pitch dark, you know, to make the clouds pass by quicker. I call it "optimising happiness".\

They are the cliche things, but things that make the sky a little less grey:

1. Go for a run, if you can't run, go for a brisk walk
2. You can listen to songs or podcast while you go for this walk, or you can breathe in, and let yourself cry if you feel like it
3. Go shopping, but that jacket or that perfume you've always wanted but never really allowed yourself to. Buy the flowers and the candles, the expensive ones that smell like heaven.
4. Light those candles
5. Clean and tidy up your environment. Throw out the things that no longer spark joy. Rearrange things, allow yourself to see things in a different way.
6. Take a shower or a bath, let yourself soak in the lavishness of it, wash yourself gently.
7. Rub your skin in sweet-smelling moisturising lotion, I don't know why, but it does wonders.
8. Wear something that feels good on your skin - notice the emphasis on the skin in the last few steps. I don't know why, but it's the superficial things - the make-up, the moisturiser, the wash gel - that really helps during this period, a kind of exorcism from the outside.
9. Find an upbeat playlist, play it out loud and just dance to it. You may not feel like it, but dance. Let your legs move, let your hands swing above you, let your head go on a roll. You will find after 3 songs in, that mood follows action.
10. Journal, not as an act of self-criticism, but as an expose to whatever you're feeling. Just put it down. No one is gonna read it, so don't feel the need to write pretty, just write it down, you will find the whole experience cathartic and healing. 
11. If you can find or afford a therapist, find one. It's a privilege to have a trained professional witness the lows of our lives and help us through it.
12. Friends and family. Resist the instinct to neglect them. Ask to catch a drink, call, check-in, ask to talk, laugh with them. They are your tribe, and the best people to wait with while the clouds pass.
13. Entertain yourself - go to the movies, travel if you can, read a good book or shitty one, watch something that makes you laugh or feel cathartic. Watch yourself come back to yourself.
