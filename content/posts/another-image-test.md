David is a good guy. You would know this, because he tells you so.

He beats his chest and says heâ€™s unlike Jackson, the arrogant ass. Unlike Tim, the pompous fool.

He reels you in with a warm smile and throws you back in with a smug smirk.

â€˜Iâ€™m not trying to be an ass here, that was a slip,â€™ he would say with a furrow in his brows, his left hand digging a pointed stick in your flesh to pick you back up - but not before he has demanded gratitude for his would-be benevolent act.

Whatever damage he causes is on account of him *just trying to live*. You are but the casualty of living. Can you see now? Itâ€™s not his fault.

When you confront him with the unintended consequences of his actions, he flares up like a caged tiger. Youâ€™ve rattled his bliss, you see?

His goodness is his armour, he wears it well.

He could never be like Jackson, nor Tim. Heâ€™s not that interesting. Heâ€™s too busy shielding his mediocrity with goodness.
