I've been dabbling in a lot of things: writing, reading, podcasting, designing side projects, building a product and a company, working a full time job, all of which are singularly gratifying, but together, exhausting.

I find myself asking, what can I drop off? How can I prevent myself from drowning in all these experiments? How can I stay afloat while I figure what sticks? How can I get things right?

Well, I don't have the answer to that yet, but it's the nature of experiments for things to suck at first, or perhaps forever. But we carry the torch for the belief that some things are worth dabbling in. How would we know they weren't that great, except we tried it?

Sometimes I pause on a beloved activity, meaning I've not produced an episode of a podcast in months. But I pause knowing I need a breather and will come back to it again when it feels right, while I save my energy to build a product that I love.

I don't know if any of my dabblings is going to be a success, but some things need to be created just because. And that's what I'm doing. Just because.
