I don’t know if it’s on account of age, but I notice the women in films now more than ever. 

You know, those women characters in films and TV shows who somehow got relegated to a back story not as important as men’s or only seen in relation to men. I now see them as full characters of their own, badass women navigating a world conjured by men and refactoring into their own fashion.

Jessica Pearson in *Suits*, Wendy Rhoades in *Billions* are a few examples that comes to mind. These are shows with premises built primarily around men and their desire for power. Men who wanted to own the world, but sprinkle a little female in there. These female characters were written as supporting roles to men; kind listening ears to their sobs or mothering figures to keep them in line. I bought these characters as they were made, that I never really noticed the arch of their development. I never saw them as extraordinary, because I was too blinded by what was going on in the men’s world. The men’s climb on the ladder seemed more important than the women for some reason. The women seemed like they were only there to make the men be better and somehow that just didn’t seem very interesting to me.

But lately, I’ve been going back to some of these TV shows and watching out for these women, revisiting how they navigated workplace and home betrayals, how they stuck to their intuition and walked the lonely roads others doubted, how they picked themselves back up when they stumbled. These imperfect but resilient women characters are becoming a collage of role models for me. Women I could easily reach out for sound advice in a watch-how-I-do-it kinda way rather than the typical hear-me-say-it kinda way.

I find myself asking ‘what would Jessica Pearson do?’, ‘how would Wendy Rhoades handle this?’ a lot more often now. Because it’s becoming apparent to me, that like it or not, these shows are a reflection of our society - the male-dominated society that we live in, in which power, the real kind of power is willed by men. To have had access or any kind of real proximity to this kind of power as a woman is to have broken so many hurdles, worked twice as hard, and screamed or muffled your voice for far too long to be heard.

The percentage of these women, these top players, is however incredibly meagre and a bit ironic since we are half the population. This means we live in a world where women don’t get to shape the solutions that deeply affect them. For younger generations who are determined to change that, it means we only see a little of these women up there to model ourselves after, since they are so scarce in our close environs. We have filled up these vacuums by celebrating fiercely the ones who do make it up there. We let their stories that come in the forms of books, podcasts, etc mentor us.

But you know where else to find this kind of mentorship? By looking closely at those female characters propped behind those male-dominated, ergo, power-themed films and tv shows. Often I’ve found these fictional characters’ journeys to be more honest than some non-fictional books. It’s less of bullshitty, if you will.

So next time you watch a movie, look closely, see that woman, truly see her and her journey, and be mentored.
