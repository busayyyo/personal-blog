I've had some terrible lapse in judgment before, but this ranks the highest, or I should say the lowest. 

At 10 PM on a Tuesday night, I rang on an ex's door, a week after he broke up with me. WHAT. THE. ACTUAL FUCK????! I still can't believe it.

It's the lowest thing I've ever done, that recovering from this colossal, irreversible fuck up has been such a struggle. I find it hard to forgive myself. I want to blame it on alcohol, but I wasn't drunk. I wanna kick my best friend for not reigning me in when this terrible idea occured to me. I hate my brain for even coming up with such a fundamentally odd idea and my body for going along with it.

You get the gist, I'm irreversibly fucked by this error in judgment. And right now, I keep wondering will I ever get over this? I ask myself, why did you go there? I know the answer to that: I wasn't thinking. I wasn't fucking thinking, but now I can't stop thinking about this.

I'm ashamed that I was capable of stooping this low - I didn't know I had it in me. I'm sad that this weird, out of character behaviour would be the last memory he (my ex, who I cherished) would ever have of me. I'm sad, terribly sad for the dent this has made on my sense of dignity.

So how does one move up after a big, gigantic, terrible, colossal fuck up such as this?

James Baldwin. Yes, you read James Baldwin who says, “You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, who had ever been alive.”

So I've been collecting stories, from books, the internet, people close to me, trying to gather as many stories of fuckups as I can. Some don't rate as high as my big fuck-up, others make mine look like a joke. 

But in reading all these stories, I've begun to feel the fabric of my dignity begin to mend. I made a terrible lapse in judgment, one for which I'm terribly sorry. But I am human. And fucking up is a human condition, I'm reading.
