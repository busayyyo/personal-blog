My disposition to life has always leaned towards that of existential nihilism — a school of thought that proposes that life has no intrinsic meaning or value. However, of recent, I’ve been on a path to find meaning, to make sense of the meaninglessness. This is what led me to Viktor Frankl’s book ‘Man’s search for meaning’.

## Dr. Frankl and his approach to meaning

Viktor Frankl was an Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist who spent 3 years at different concentration camps during the second world war, including Auschwitz. If there was anyone who understood suffering and its effect on peoples’ psyche, it was Dr. Frankl.

Man’s search for meaning is a psychological memoir of a prisoner of war. It’s an attempt to make sense of the suffering witnessed and endured at the concentration camp. But even Dr. Frankl couldn’t accurately do justice to that. There was no sense in the killings, the starvation, the torture and many unimaginable things that went on at Auschwitz and other internment camps.

If there was any meaning to be found at all (whether in general life or in the harshest of sufferings such as the concentration camp), Dr. Frankl proposes it is an individual and a moment-to-moment one. There’s no singular universal and collective meaning for us all. Meaning is unique to individuals and their situations, and it behooves on them to find out what it is.

This individualistic approach to meaning is the central theme of this book. The idea that one could choose their response to whatever life deals them and could choose to find meaning in it, even a fate as fatal as that of a war prisoner. As Dr. Frankl solemnly surmised: “everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”

## How to go about finding meaning

So how does one go about finding these highly individualistic meanings? Dr. Frankl posited that there are 3 ways:

**Meaning through work:** Through creative work and deeds, one could find meaning. After all, the thought of completing his manuscript — his life’s work, had kept Dr. Frankl alive in prison. If we do something we care about, it can keep us grounded and give us meaning.

**Meaning through love:** The second way to find meaning is by experiencing or encountering someone. Love, as the book describes it, “is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality.” This act of love opens us up in ways unimaginable and the book argues that love has the potential to actualize people, both the lover and the beloved.

**Meaning through suffering:** The third and final way one could find meaning is by suffering with dignity. Although this book insisted that suffering is not a necessity to meaning, it, however, asserts that meaning could be found in spite of suffering. When confronted with pain, fear, and death one could turn the hopelessness around by finding meaning in the sacrifice. As Dr. Frankl pointed out, “in some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.”

## Back to existential nihilism

Now, if these, especially the last bit of finding meaning through suffering seems a bit too feel-good to be realistic, that’s because it is. Viktor Frankl himself tagged it as ‘tragic optimism’ — the idea that life holds any meaning in spite of death, pain, and guilt. But what Viktor Frankl seems to wager is this: man is capable of creating optimism even in the direst of condition, and if he is, then he is capable of also creating meaning. Because God knows, what else is there?
