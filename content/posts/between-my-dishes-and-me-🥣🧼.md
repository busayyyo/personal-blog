description: I'm not a medicine man, but I have this deep sense that my
  dishwashing habit is now very symbiotic to my mental state. Two unrelated
  organisms orbiting each other's space, relying on the other for wholeness.
  When everything is in order, I tend to do my dishes immediately after a meal.
  When things are less than ideal, unbalanced - at work, extracurriculars, or in
  the way my body moves in this world - the plates fester..

As a child, there was nothing I loathed more than doing dishes. 

I hated any forms of house chores, and of all house chores, doing dishes ranked the worst. I sought ways to get out of it and I particularly hated it when we had visitors which meant that the dishes stacked higher. To ten-year-old me, there was no greater punishment.

27 year old me feels way more mature about it. I can tolerate it in the sense that I like the warmness of the water on my hands, the frothing lather, the plates going from the speckled color of oil to sparkling clean; another thing off my to-do list.

Some days I do my dishes immediately after a meal, some days I leave it in the sink, letting it soak till the next meal. On other days, they pile up over two meals, or maybe three; as do my anxieties and depression.

I'm not a medicine man, but I have this deep sense that my dishwashing habit is now very symbiotic to my mental state. Two unrelated organisms orbiting each other's space, relying on the other for wholeness. When everything is in order, I tend to do my dishes immediately after a meal. When things are less than ideal, unbalanced - at work, extracurriculars, or in the way my body moves in this world - the plates fester.

I look at them in the sink and I can't help them, just as I can't help me at that moment. So I lie down, or take a walk or simply breathe, waiting for me to come back to me. 

I'm writing this because I've found a hack, I think, a way to find me quicker on the days the things I can't see threatens my sanity. A way to kick the door open and let new air come in. Or rather, a thing to do. Like a medicine man who's never tasted his own potion, I tell myself, just dip your hands in the sink water until the warmth becomes familiar. And then, do one dish, and maybe another. One at a time.

I can't change the brain chemicals, the depression, and the anxiety that lingers, but if I can clean this dish, I can get my kitchen back in order, and perhaps my life.
