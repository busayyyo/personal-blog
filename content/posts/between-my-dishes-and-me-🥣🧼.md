description: I have a feeling my dishwashing habit is now very symbiotic to my
  mental state. Two unrelated organisms orbiting each other's space, relying on
  the other for wholeness. When everything is in order, I tend to do my dishes
  immediately after a meal. When things are less than ideal, unbalanced - at
  work, extracurriculars, or in the way my body moves in this world - the plates
  fester..

As a child, there was nothing I loathed more than doing dishes. I hated any forms of house chores, and of all house chores, doing dishes ranked the worst. I sought ways to get out of it and I particularly hated it when we had visitors which meant that the dishes stacked higher. To ten-year-old me, there was no greater punishment.

27 year old me feels way more mature about it. I can tolerate it in the sense that I like the warmness of the water on my hands, the frothing lather, the plates going from the speckled color of oil to sparkling clean; another thing off my to-do list.

Some days I do my dishes immediately after a meal, some days I leave it in the sink, letting it soak till the next meal. Somedays they pile up over two meals, or maybe three; as do my anxieties and depression.

I have a feeling my dishwashing habit is now very symbiotic to my mental state. Two unrelated organisms orbiting each other's space, relying on the other for wholeness. When everything is in order, I tend to do my dishes immediately after a meal. When things are less than ideal, unbalanced - at work, extracurriculars, or in the way my body moves in this world - the plates fester.

I look at them in the sink and I can't help them, just as I can't help me at that moment. So I lie down, or take a walk or simply breathe, waiting for me to come back to me. 

I'm writing this because I've found a hack, I think, a way to find me quicker on the days the things I can't see threatens my sanity. A way to kick the door open and let new air come in. Or rather, a thing to do. Like a medicine man who's never tasted his own potion, I tell myself, just dip your hands in the sink water until the warmth becomes familiar. And then, do one dish, and maybe another. One at a time.

I can't change the brain chemicals, the depression, and the anxiety that lingers, but if I can clean this dish, I can get my kitchen back in order, and perhaps my life.
