Someone asked me what my new year resolution was. I replied, let it be.

But more than that, I'm resolved to not repeat 2020 mistakes. I made a lot of mistakes this year. Gosh, I did. 

However, I'm resolved not to repeat my 2020 mistakes in 2021, and one only avoid mistakes by iterating the lessons one has learnt. Here are a few things 2020 has taught me. I intend not to learn them again.

1. **Trust your gut** - I'd have saved myself a few heartaches if I took this seriously. Your gut says no, then it's a hell no. Don't know what your gut is saying? Pay more attention to how you feel and move in the world. A lot of data in there.

2. **Own it** - Whatever you do or say, own it. It's your life, you and only you get to own the direction and consequences. Any other thing besides what you choose is merely a suggestion.

3. **Don't fall apart for anyone** - People will come and go in your life as is their prerogative. Let them. Not everyone is meant to stay. 

4. **Still, fight** - Some people are worth fighting for.. you will know when you meet them. So try, fight. Even if it's just so you could tell yourself you did everything you could.

5. **Reach out** - Put out a tweet, a word into the universe. Ask for help when you need it. Be open to vulnerability. You'd be surprised at the responses you may get in return.

6. **Forgive yourself** - It's so hard for me to forgive myself when I err. But I'm learning, cos I'm a colossal waste of space when I do not. I can't move forward and I can't go back - forever stuck in the messiness of what could have been. Forgive yourself quickly to move on to greater and better things.

7. **Don't assume, ask** - A lot of fights and heartaches would have been spared if I had asked questions instead of ascribing malicious motives to wrongdoings. Assume nothing, ask. 

8. **Don't let fuckups lag** - When you fuck up, don't wait a minute to set things right. It festers when you do. Own it, apologise, explain immediately. Do not let it fester.

9. **Be kind to everyone** - Life's just easier when it's your default to be kind to everyone. Even when they are annoying.

10. **Let it be** - Slow down, let things play out. Be an active observer of your life. You will make better and more rational moves that way.



Cheers to 2021. Here's hoping it's kinder and gentler than 2020.
